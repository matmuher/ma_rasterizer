I. Triangles

    1. class Canvas to manipulate with single canvas
    2. draw line
    3. draw filled triangle
    4. draw shaded triangle

II. 3D projecting

    [pixel array: real place of pixel]:

        [0,0]---------[1280]>
        |
        |
        |
        \/

    [canvas: to work with pixel array in more natural way, with 4 quadrants]:
    // shifted pixel_array

                ^
                |
                |
        [-640]---------[640]>
                |
                |

    [view port: about scene]
    // scaled canvas

                ^
                |
                |
        [-1.0]---------[1.0]>
                |
                |

    1. Convertion functions:
        * From canvas --to--> pixel array
        * From view port --to--> canvas

    2. Project vertex
